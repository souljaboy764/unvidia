# unvidia
Bash script to undo the damage done by nvidia and cuda like blank screen and login loop.
Replace the first line in the script with the path to uninstall_cuda_7.5.pl in your system

Note: This removes cuda and nvidia drivers and it replaces it with the standard nouveau driver. If you want to keep nvidia and cuda, then do not run this script.
